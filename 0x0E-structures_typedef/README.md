The C language contains the typedef keyword to allow users to provide alternative names for the primitive (e.g.,​ int) and user-defined​ (e.g struct) data types.

Remember, this keyword adds a new name for some existing data type but does not create a new type.

Using typedef struct results in a cleaner, more readable code, and saves the programmer keystrokes​. However, it also leads to a more cluttered global namespace which can be problematic for large programs.
